# CS 193 Homework 1 - CS 193 Website
Throughout this homework you will create a personal GitHub account, use that GitHub account to modify some code from the homework repository, and then submit it to us for grading! This same basic process will be used throughout CS193 to complete and turn in all of your homeworks. For this first one, we're focusing on getting you used to the process.

## Step 1 - Set up a Personal Github Account
If you already have a personal Github account and have activated your Student Developer Pack (i.e. you can create private repositories), feel free to ignore this section.  If not, read on!

Github is a service that combines the git version control system with code hosting and project management services. Basically it allows people to work together :). Throughout most of your career as a Software Developer, you'll be using Github (or something similar) A LOT, so let's go ahead and get you set up with an account.

Hop on over to the [Github website](https://github.com/). Once you're there, click on the [Sign Up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) link in the upper right to create your account. Choose a memorable, but **PROFESSIONAL**, username (you'll probably have your Github username listed on your resume and be handing it out to companies regularly). **Use your Purdue email address to create this account.** This will allow you to unlock some sweet benefits that Github gives to students for free.

Once your Github account is all set up, you need to request access to the Github Student Developer pack. To do this, navigate to the [Student Developer Pack website](https://education.github.com/pack) and follow the steps there to request access. As soon as you have access to the student benefits, you can continue on with this homework.

## Step 2 - Email your PSO TAs Your GitHub Username
**IF YOU DON'T DO THIS STEP WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GRADE YOUR HOMEWORKS**

Now that you have a GitHub account set up, email your TAs your GitHub username (send it to all TAs for your section, you can find their emails in the course syllabus).  Note that we need your **GitHub username**, not your email!

## Step 3 - Accept the Homework 1 Assignment
Following the link we gave you to Homework 1, click the "Accept" button to begin importing the homework 1 repository for your own personal use. You should receive an email when this is complete (<1 minute).

Now head on over to [github.com](https://github.com/) and (if you're logged in and everything went smoothly) you should see a new repository called **Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019/homework-1-\<Your Github Username\>**. You will be editing some files in this repository to complete your homework.

## Step 4 - Create Your Own Website!
The repository that was just created for you is already set up with a simple file that displays a basic website. The website content is found in the index.md file. Throughout this homework you will be editing this file to create your own content for this website.

To active the website so you can visit it in a browser, click on the **Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019/homework-1-\<Your Github Username\>** repository from your Github home page. In the upper right corner, click on the **Settings** button. Scroll down to the section called **GitHub Pages**. Change the **Source** setting to the option called **master branch** and click save. At this point, you can navigate to ```https://Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019.github.io/homework-1-<Your Github Username>/``` to view the website you just activated!

Right now, there isn't any meaningful content in this website, just a placeholder that tells you a little about what you can do with the website template.

## Step 5 - Edit Your Website
Having just a template website is pretty boring. To edit your website to display more interesting content, go back to the main page for the **Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019/homework-1-\<Your Github Username\>** repository.

From here, click on the **index.md** file. You should see the same content you viewed at ```https://Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019.github.io/homework-1-<Your Github Username>/``` except this time it is not themed.

To edit this file, click on the **edit** button (it looks like a little pencil) in the upper right hand corner of the file display. This will open a text editor where you can change the contents of the website to whatever you want. Take a few minutes to experiment with the different formatting tools that the website template tells you are available.

To save your changes so that they will display on your website, fill out the **Commit Changes** form at the bottom by describing what you changed on the website. Select the option called **Commit directly to the master branch** and click **Commit changes**. If all is well, you should be able to navigate back to ```https://Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019.github.io/homework-1-<Your Github Username>/``` and view the changes you made.

**Your changes may not load immediately. If you do not see any changes, hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on macs).**

## Step 6 - The Graded Part (**THIS PART IS WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GRADING**)
When you're ready, create a **heading** (a heading is some text that is preceded by a `# `, note the space after the #) to title your website
**\<Your Name\>'s First CS193 Homework**

Next, create a bulleted list of some of your favorite things about CS193 (if you don't have any, I'll be sad :( but try to make some up anyway).  Bulleted lists are a series of lines that each start with a `- ` followed by your text.  You can see an example in `index.md`.

When you're done, commit your changes, just as you did above and you're done! **CONGRATULATIONS** you just completed your first CS193 homework :) Give yourself a pat on the back and bask in the glory of your brand new fancy GitHub Website!

## Optional Extra - Change the Theme of Your Website
If you aren't a fan of the super cool hacker theme that I chose to be the default of your website, you can easily change it.
Navigate to the settings page for your **Purdue-CS193-Fall-2019/homework-1-\<Your Github Username\>** and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Click on **Change theme** and pick your favorite theme!
